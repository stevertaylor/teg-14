To the editor and referee,

We wish to thank the anonymous referee for taking the time to review our work, and for their comments. We took much time to get the figures in a suitable format and to make sure that they remain legibible upon printing out. We will stay in close communication with the editorial staff during the proofing stage to make sure that the figures and fonts remain legible. If at any point during this we feel the quality of the figures is compromised then we will endeavour to fix any problems as rapidly as possible.

Other comments are addressed below.
